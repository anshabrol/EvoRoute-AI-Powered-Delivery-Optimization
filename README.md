# EvoRoute: AI-Powered Delivery Optimization

## Overview

EvoRoute is a delivery route optimization system that leverages **Genetic Algorithms (GA)** to find the most efficient paths for deliveries. This approach improves **logistics efficiency**, reduces delivery time, and minimizes fuel consumption by evolving better routes over multiple generations.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm-Based Optimization**: Uses **selection, crossover, and mutation** to optimize delivery routes.
- **Dynamic Route Adjustments**: Adapts routes based on real-world constraints like **traffic, delivery windows, and vehicle capacity**.
- **Performance Evaluation**: Implements **fitness functions** to assess route efficiency.
- **Scalability**: Can handle a large number of delivery locations and vehicles.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and maps for analyzing optimized routes.


## How It Works

1. **Initialize Population**: Randomly generate initial delivery routes.
2. **Evaluate Fitness**: Compute the total distance or time for each route.
3. **Selection**: Pick the best-performing routes.
4. **Crossover**: Combine two routes to create better offspring routes.
5. **Mutation**: Introduce slight route modifications to explore better solutions.
6. **Repeat**: Iterate over multiple generations to refine the solution.

## Results

- Achieved **60% improvement** in delivery efficiency compared to traditional methods.
- Reduced **average delivery time by 20%**.

## Future Enhancements

- Integrate **real-time traffic data**.
- Extend support for **multi-vehicle routing**.
- Implement **reinforcement learning** for further optimization.
